# hut_ai_project1
Artificial Intelligence course final project 01

Implemented an AI palyer for the custom game of the course, I exactly don't remember
what the game was about (I'm writing this README after months finishing that course) but agents follow Mini-Max algorithm.

I also need to note this code is *"BUGGY"*! Visit `hut_ai_project2` for having better expreince with my first AI projects.

I only keep this code here as a diary, it "DOSE NOT" work.
